    <h3>Reliable Real Estate Representation</h3>
    <p>The FRIEDMAN LLP Law Firm   serves buyers, sellers, investors,   developers, builders, contractors and   others in all matters involving   residential and commercial real estate,   including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real estate disputes</li>
      <li>Commericial leases</li>
      <li>Closings</li>
      <li>Landlord-Tenant disputes</li>
      <li>Purchase and sale agreements</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Representation In All Types Of Real Estate Litigation</h3>
    <p>While we handle real estate matters and transactions, our   practice   focuses on litigation. When needed, we are prepared to go to   trial. We   resolve disputes between buyers and real estate agents or   brokers,   including disputes over agent agreements. We resolve boundary   line   disputes. We are experienced in resolving a variety of real   estate   disputes. We overcome challenges. That is what we do.</p>
    <p>We represent real estate agents opposite clients and the   Toronto Real   Estate Commission. Our work also includes the   representation of   individuals against <strong>real estate agents</strong> and <strong>real estate management companies</strong> for breach of fiduciary duty. We have brought verified claims and     applications to courts for orders directing payment of judgment from the     Real Estate Recovery Trust Account.</p>
    <p>We also handle <strong>easements,</strong> including utility     easements. In real estate transactions, there are often situations in     which sellers and developers are sued for allegedly selling real estate     property without disclosing easements — even though the purchaser     obtained their own survey reports. We work to prevent and resolve these     types of disputes.</p>
    <p>We also handle situations in which individuals believe that they have <strong>oil and gas royalty interests</strong> in real property by inheritance but are uncertain as to the extent. Our     researchers can conduct title searches and examinations to determine     who has the royalty interest.</p>
    <p>Our Toronto real estate lawyer’s experience in <strong>landlord-tenant</strong> matters includes representing both landlords and commercial tenants     negotiate leases. We assist commercial landlords in situations dealing     with tenant breaches or tenant’s failure to pay rent. We help   commercial   and residential landlords in tenant lock-outs and   evictions. We help   landlords understand their responsibilities as   required by the Toronto   Property Code. Oftentimes, landlords engage in   wrongful lockouts of   tenants and wrongfully withhold rental deposits.   We help them follow the   procedures required by the Toronto Property   Code.</p>
    <p>Our real estate law firm also represents clients with <strong>zoning, restrictions and land use planning</strong> concerns such as seeking amendments or variances to deed restrictions.     For example, we can assist clients who want to change the use   limitation   on residential lots to a commercial lot. We assist clients   whose goal   is to have their property exempt from certain constraints   contained in   the restrictions, which limit the use and nature of the   real property.</p>
    <p>In potential purchase and sale situations involving individual     purchasers and a builder/developer purchaser, our real estate attorney     can review deed restrictions for matters limiting use and causing     certain building restrictions. We advise clients on restrictions. Our     real estate law firm advises clients on the current status of land use,     whether residential or commercial, and advise on the process for   change.</p>
    <h3>Experience | Loyalty | Communication | Results</h3>
    <p>We understand that the primary goal in all real estate matters   is the   achievement of positive results. Our attorneys has the   experience   necessary to achieve the results our clients need. Our   clients also   appreciate our loyalty, as well as our honest   communication of   information </p>
