  <div class="GridColSidebar padMargin"> <span class="Topic308"><strong>Pro Bono & Law Reform Activities</strong></span>
    <p>We believe in using our resources to serve the greater good.   Over   the last three years we have contributed over 1000 hours to   pro-bono   activities. We have a dedicated pro-bono committee which vets     initiatives proposed by lawyers to ensure that we are supporting quality     programs in a meaningful way. The pro-bono committee and firm   encourage   and support our lawyers in doing pro-bono work with various     organizations.
    <p>We contribute to making legal services available   to those who   would otherwise be unable to access them. Pro Bono Law BC   has   described our firm as “a strong supporter of pro-bono legal   services.”</p>
    <p>Examples of our recent work include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing pro bono advice to Pivot Legal with respect to the application for a safe injection site.</li>
      <li>Providing pro bono employment advice to Folk on the Rocks, an annual music and cultural festival hosted in Yellowknife.</li>
      <li>Acting   as pro-bono counsel to Can Praxis, Canada’s leading   provider of equine   therapy treating veterans of the Canadian Armed   Forces, first responders   and their families struggling with   post-traumatic stress disorder and   operational stress injury.</li>
      <li>Providing legal advice to a society working to connect aspiring farmers with owners of unused land.</li>
      <li>Assisting an individual to have a Certificate of Incapacity vacated.</li>
      <li>Incorporating   an organization that has developed   technology to identify handicRow6ed   parking spaces to municipal bylaw   officials for ticketing as a charity   for tax purposes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Representing the Canadian Bar Association in   a long pro   bono retainer at all levels of court in a case where the   Federation of   Law Societies of Canada challenged the constitutionality   of   provisions of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and <em>Terrorist Financing Act</em> and its Regulations that would require lawyers to record client     information about certain transactions involving the receipt or payment     of funds by lawyers, and which purport to authorize wide-ranging     warrantless searches of lawyers’ offices by FINTRAC to ensure compliance     with the Act and Regulations. The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision     reaffirmed the protection of the solicitor-client relationship from     state interference, and recognizes a lawyer’s duty of commitment to     their client’s cause as a principle of fundamental justice.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Representing   the British Columbia Civil Liberties   Association (BCCLA) as intervener   in A.B. v. Bragg Communications   Inc., 2012 SCC 46. In that case, a 15   year old girl sought assistance   from the courts to uncover the identity   of the person who created a   fake Facebook profile of her containing   allegedly defamatory remarks. A   unanimous Court agreed with the BCCLA’s   position that any harm to   A.B. from having to reveal her identity could   be avoided by allowing   her to proceed anonymously, but that freedom of   expression and the   open courts principle required publication of the   fake profile.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In 2010, FRIEDMAN LLP Law Firm won Gold at the Lexpert   Pro Bono   Zenith Awards honouring pro-bono contributions in the Civil   Liberties   category for our work with the BC Civil Liberties Association.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Throughout   the firm’s history, FRIEDMAN LLP Law Firm has recognized its   duties to both   the legal profession and the larger community.  Our   lawyers have filled   executive positions in many legal organizations,   including the   presidencies of the Law Society of British Columbia, the   Canadian Bar   Association and the Federation of Law Societies of   Canada. Our lawyers   are frequent speakers to both professional and   business groups and   volunteer their time as instructors in legal   training programs. Several   of our lawyers have also assisted in   drafting sample legislation and   amendments to legislation.</p>
